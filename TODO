# DesQ Shell

## MultiProcess Shell
1. Shell Manager - Pure console app to manage the Shell Components
  - Manager will keep track of all the components
  - Use QProcess (and not QProcess::startDetached) to start the processes
  - If any QProcess dies (exit code is non zero), intimate the user
    and restart the process.
  - New options:
    - `start-process /path/to/process or desq-process` (like bg, panel, etc)
    - `kill-process /path/to/process or desq-process` (like bg, panel, etc)
    - `restart-process /path/to/process or desq-process` (like bg, panel, etc)

2. Shell BG      - Background-only component
3. Shell Widgets - Desktop Widgets
  - Each widget is a separate process
  - Typical Widgets are
    - SNI
    - DesQ SuperButton
    - Clock
    - UsageBars
    - Volume
    - Backlight
    - Pager
  - All widgets are movable [To be implemented]
  - Widget positions are relative to screen size
4. Panel         - Start the panel (if enabled)
5. Dock          - Start the dock (if enabled)

## IO Process Manager
We need a smooth IO manager that performs the copy/move operations on behalf of the file manager or any other application.
We can easily provide a IO Progress Meter in the system tray to track the progress.

### DBus Interface for Copying/Moving/... files/folders
- `qdbus org.DesQ.Shell /org/DesQ/Shell DesQ.IO.Copy [Path1, Path2, Path3, ...] Target`
- `qdbus org.DesQ.Shell /org/DesQ/Shell DesQ.IO.Move [Path1, Path2, Path3, ...] Target`
- `qdbus org.DesQ.Shell /org/DesQ/Shell DesQ.IO.Link [Path1, Path2, Path3, ...] Target`
- `qdbus org.DesQ.Shell /org/DesQ/Shell DesQ.IO.Trash [Path1, Path2, Path3, ...] Target`
- `qdbus org.DesQ.Shell /org/DesQ/Shell DesQ.IO.Delete [Path1, Path2, Path3, ...] Target`
